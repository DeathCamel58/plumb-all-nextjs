      <p className="mb-6">
        When water starts seeping through your ceiling from an upstairs bathroom, quick action is essential.
        Identifying the source of the leak and stopping the water flow should be your immediate priorities.
        Ignoring this issue can lead to significant water damage throughout your home. This guide will help
        you pinpoint the cause and take appropriate steps to address the problem.

          <strong>Important:</strong> Water damage can quickly escalate from a minor inconvenience to a major
          structural problem. If you notice water stains, bubbling paint, or active dripping from your ceiling,
          address the issue immediately to prevent further damage to your home&#39;s structure, electrical systems,
          and personal belongings.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Sources of Upstairs Bathroom Leaks</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        When dealing with water leaks from an upstairs bathroom and you&#39;re unsure of their origin,
        it&#39;s best to inspect three key plumbing fixtures: the toilet, the tub/shower, and the sink.
        Each of these fixtures can develop specific issues that lead to water leaking through to the ceiling below.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Toilet Leaks</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The seal between the toilet and the floor, known as a wax ring, is a common source of leaks.
          When this seal deteriorates or becomes damaged, water can seep into the subfloor and eventually
          through the ceiling whenever the toilet is flushed.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Signs of a Faulty Wax Ring:</h4>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Water pooling around the base of the toilet</li>
          <li>Unpleasant sewer gas odor in the bathroom</li>
          <li>Water stains on the ceiling directly below the toilet</li>
          <li>Toilet that rocks or feels unstable when sat upon</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Even if you don&#39;t see visible water around the toilet base, a compromised wax ring can still
          allow water to penetrate the subfloor during flushing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Shower and Tub Leaks</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Shower and tub leaks can be more complex to diagnose as they can originate from several sources:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Damaged shower tiles or grout</strong> - Cracked tiles or deteriorated grout can allow water to penetrate behind the shower walls</li>
          <li><strong>Shower faucet leaks</strong> - Issues with the faucet assembly inside the wall can cause hidden leaks</li>
          <li><strong>Water supply pipe leaks</strong> - Pipes within the wall or subfloor may develop leaks due to corrosion or joint failures</li>
          <li><strong>Drain leaks</strong> - The drain assembly or p-trap beneath the shower/tub can develop leaks at connection points</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          If the leak occurs only when the shower is in use, the issue is likely related to the shower enclosure
          or faucet. If the leak persists even when the shower isn&#39;t being used, the problem may be with a water
          supply pipe hidden in the wall or subfloor.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Sink Leaks</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <Link href="/services/bathroom-plumbing" className="text-theme-3 hover:underline">Bathroom sink leaks</Link> typically stem from issues with gaskets, washers, or connection points:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Faucet assembly leaks</strong> - Worn gaskets or washers in the faucet can cause water to leak around the base or handles</li>
          <li><strong>Drain assembly leaks</strong> - The drain components beneath the sink bowl may develop leaks at connection points</li>
          <li><strong>Supply line leaks</strong> - The flexible water supply lines connecting to the faucet can develop leaks at their connections</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Gaskets are flat seals, typically made of rubber or plastic, positioned between surfaces like the base
          of the faucet assembly and the vanity top. Washers are circular seals used beneath screws in a faucet
          assembly. When any of these components wear out or become damaged, they no longer create a secure seal,
          allowing water to escape.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Check all connection points beneath your sink and tighten any loose fittings to ensure proper seals.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Diagnosing the Source of the Leak</h2>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Step-by-Step Leak Investigation</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Examine the ceiling damage</strong> - Note the location of water stains or dripping to help identify which fixture is above the affected area</li>
          <li><strong>Inspect each fixture</strong> - Check the toilet, shower/tub, and sink for visible signs of leakage</li>
          <li><strong>Perform isolated tests</strong> - Use each fixture separately while someone watches the ceiling below for new drips or increased moisture</li>
          <li><strong>Check for hidden leaks</strong> - Look for water stains, warped flooring, or mold growth around fixtures that might indicate slow, ongoing leaks</li>
          <li><strong>Assess pipe locations</strong> - Consider whether the leak could be coming from water supply or drain pipes running through the floor/ceiling space</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To determine if a toilet&#39;s wax ring is leaking, place a few drops of food
          coloring in the toilet tank and flush. If colored water appears around the base of the toilet or on
          the ceiling below, you&#39;ve confirmed a wax ring leak.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Temporary Measures While Awaiting Repairs</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        While you&#39;re diagnosing the issue or waiting for professional help, take these steps to minimize damage:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contain the water</strong> - Place buckets or containers to catch dripping water</li>
          <li><strong>Turn off water supply</strong> - Locate and shut off the water supply to the leaking fixture or the main water supply if necessary</li>
          <li><strong>Remove valuable items</strong> - Move furniture, electronics, and other valuables away from the affected area</li>
          <li><strong>Dry the area</strong> - Use towels, fans, or a wet/dry vacuum to remove standing water and begin drying the affected areas</li>
          <li><strong>Document the damage</strong> - Take photos of the damage for insurance purposes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
