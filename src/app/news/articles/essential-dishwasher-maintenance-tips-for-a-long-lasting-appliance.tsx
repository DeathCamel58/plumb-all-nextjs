      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          Did you know? The average dishwasher should last between 7-12 years, but with proper maintenance, many can function efficiently for up to 15 years or more!
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        That moment when you open your dishwasher expecting sparkling clean dishes, only to find food particles still clinging to your plates—frustrating, isn&#39;t it? Or perhaps you&#39;ve noticed an unpleasant odor whenever you open the door. These are telltale signs that your dishwasher is crying out for some attention.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Your dishwasher works tirelessly day after day, efficiently cleaning your dishes while saving water and energy compared to hand washing. But like any hardworking appliance, it needs regular maintenance to keep performing at its best. The good news? Most dishwasher maintenance is simple enough for any homeowner to handle.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5 Essential Maintenance Tasks for a Spotless Dishwasher</h2>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-6">
        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Inspect and Maintain the Door Seal</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">The rubber gasket around your dishwasher door is critical for preventing leaks, but it&#39;s often the first component to deteriorate.</p>
          <p><strong>Signs of Problems:</strong> Water puddles on the floor, dampness around cabinets, or visible cracks in the rubber.</p>
          <p><strong>DIY Difficulty:</strong> Low - Inspection is easy, replacement may require professional help.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Wipe the gasket monthly with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar to prevent mold and extend its life.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Clean the Filter Screen</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Modern dishwashers have a filter at the bottom that catches food particles and prevents them from clogging your plumbing.</p>
          <p><strong>Signs of Problems:</strong> Poor cleaning performance, food particles remaining on dishes, or unpleasant odors.</p>
          <p><strong>DIY Difficulty:</strong> Low - Most filters twist out easily for cleaning.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mark your calendar to clean the filter every 1-2 months. Rinse it under hot water and use an old toothbrush to remove stubborn debris.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Clean the Spray Arms</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">The spray arms distribute water throughout your dishwasher, but their nozzles can become clogged with mineral deposits or food particles.</p>
          <p><strong>Signs of Problems:</strong> Dishes not getting completely clean, especially on the top rack.</p>
          <p><strong>DIY Difficulty:</strong> Medium - Requires removing the arms and cleaning each nozzle.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a toothpick or small wire to clear individual spray holes, then soak the arms in white vinegar for 15-20 minutes to dissolve mineral buildup.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Eliminate Mold and Mildew</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">The warm, moist environment inside your dishwasher can become a breeding ground for mold and mildew.</p>
          <p><strong>Signs of Problems:</strong> Musty smell, visible black or green spots inside the dishwasher.</p>
          <p><strong>DIY Difficulty:</strong> Low - A simple vinegar wash can solve most mold issues.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Run an empty cycle with two cups of white vinegar placed in a dishwasher-safe container on the top rack. For stubborn mold, follow with a cycle using a cup of baking soda sprinkled on the bottom.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Check and Adjust Leveling</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">A properly leveled dishwasher ensures optimal water drainage and prevents premature wear on components.</p>
          <p><strong>Signs of Problems:</strong> Water pooling inside after cycles, uneven cleaning results, or unusual noises during operation.</p>
          <p><strong>DIY Difficulty:</strong> Medium - Requires adjusting the feet under the dishwasher.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Place a level on the bottom rack and adjust the feet until the bubble is centered. Check both side-to-side and front-to-back.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
