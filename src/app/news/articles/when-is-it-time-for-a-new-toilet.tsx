        By recognizing these indicators, you can make an educated decision about when to upgrade and benefit
        from the professional guidance and installation services offered by Plumb-All.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Signs You Need a New Toilet</h2>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Indicators It&#39;s Time for a Replacement</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Frequent repairs:</strong> Constant fixes for leaks, clogs, or flushing issues</li>
          <li><strong>Visible cracks or damage:</strong> Porcelain damage that can lead to leaks</li>
          <li><strong>Persistent clogs:</strong> Regular blockages despite plunging efforts</li>
          <li><strong>Inefficient water usage:</strong> Older models that waste water with each flush</li>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> Toilets approaching or exceeding their 15-20 year lifespan</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Frequent Repairs</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Are you finding yourself in a constant cycle of fixing your toilet due to recurring problems like leaks,
        clogs, or flushing issues? This frequent need for repairs is a clear indication that it&#39;s time to consider
        a toilet replacement.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Constantly tinkering with your toilet can become both time-consuming and expensive, making the installation
        of a new, reliable toilet a more cost-effective long-term solution. Don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch with
        Plumb-All for expert advice on selecting a toilet that meets your specific needs.
      </p>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep track of your repair costs. If you&#39;ve spent more than 30% of the cost of a new toilet on repairs within a year, replacement is usually more economical than continued repairs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Cracks or Damage</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Visible cracks or damage in the porcelain bowl or tank are substantial red flags that your toilet requires
        replacement. These imperfections can result in water leaks, wasting both water and potentially causing damage
        to your bathroom floor and its surroundings.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you detect any of these issues, it&#39;s crucial to consult with Plumb-All to evaluate the situation and
        determine the most appropriate course of action.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Even hairline cracks in your toilet can lead to significant water damage over time.
          These small imperfections often worsen with regular use and temperature fluctuations, eventually causing leaks
          that may damage your subfloor and create conditions for mold growth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Constant Clogs</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Persistent toilet clogs that resist standard plunging or home remedies may be symptomatic of a larger
        underlying problem. Older toilets with outdated designs or low water flow may struggle to handle modern
        water-saving practices.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Upgrading to a new toilet with enhanced flushing power and efficient water usage can effectively resolve
        constant clogging issues while improving overall performance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Outdated Design and Inefficiency</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If your toilet&#39;s design is outdated, it likely lacks the features and technology found in newer models.
        Older toilets often consume more water with each flush, leading to higher water bills and unnecessary waste.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Taking into consideration the age of your toilet is a key factor in assessing its condition. Typically,
        toilets have a lifespan of approximately 15-20 years, which can vary depending on usage and maintenance.
      </p>

        If your toilet is approaching or surpassing this age range, it&#39;s prudent to start thinking about a replacement.
        Upgrading to a new toilet can provide peace of mind, improved efficiency, and an aesthetic boost to your bathroom.
