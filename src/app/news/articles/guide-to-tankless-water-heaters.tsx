      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> Tankless water heaters can be 24-34% more energy efficient than traditional
          tank water heaters and can last up to 20 years. However, they cost 2-3 times more upfront and may require
          significant installation modifications to your home&#39;s electrical or gas systems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand or instantaneous water heaters, have become increasingly popular
        among homeowners looking for energy-efficient alternatives to traditional tank water heaters. But are they right
        for your home? Let&#39;s explore the pros and cons to help you make an informed decision.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What Are Tankless Water Heaters?</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Unlike traditional water heaters that store and continuously heat water in a large tank, tankless water heaters
        heat water on-demand as it flows through the unit. When you turn on a hot water tap, cold water travels through
        a pipe into the unit where either a gas burner or electric element heats the water instantly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Pros of Tankless Water Heaters</h3>

      <div className="bg-green-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-green-200">
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-800">✓ Key Advantages</h4>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">1. Energy Efficiency</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Tankless water heaters are typically 24-34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water
              heaters for homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily. They only heat water when needed,
              eliminating standby energy losses that occur with traditional tank systems.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">2. Space Savings</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These compact units can be mounted on walls and take up significantly less space than bulky storage tanks.
              This is especially beneficial for smaller homes, apartments, or utility rooms where space is at a premium.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">3. Unlimited Hot Water Supply</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              With proper sizing, tankless water heaters can provide a continuous supply of hot water. You&#39;ll never
              run out of hot water during long showers or when multiple appliances are running simultaneously.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">4. Longer Lifespan</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Tankless water heaters typically last 15-20 years, compared to 8-12 years for traditional tank water
              heaters. This longer lifespan can offset the higher initial investment over time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">5. Reduced Risk of Water Damage</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Since there&#39;s no storage tank that can burst or leak, the risk of catastrophic water damage is
              significantly reduced.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Cons of Tankless Water Heaters</h3>

      <div className="bg-red-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-red-200">
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-red-800">⚠ Key Disadvantages</h4>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">1. Higher Upfront Costs</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Tankless water heaters cost significantly more upfront than traditional tank units. Installation costs can
              also be higher, especially if electrical or gas line upgrades are needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">2. Limited Flow Rate</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              While tankless units provide unlimited hot water, they have a limited flow rate (typically 2-5 gallons per
              minute). Running multiple hot water appliances simultaneously may result in reduced water temperature.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">3. Inconsistent Water Temperature</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Some users experience temperature fluctuations, especially when water demand varies. This &#34;cold water
              sandwich&#34; effect can occur when hot water use is intermittent.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">4. Complex Installation Requirements</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Installation may require upgrades to electrical systems, gas lines, or venting systems. This complexity
              can increase installation costs and time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">5. Higher Maintenance Requirements</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Tankless units require regular maintenance, including annual descaling in areas with hard water.
              Neglecting maintenance can reduce efficiency and lifespan. Unlike traditional water heaters that need
              <Link href="/news/articles/flushing-your-water-heater" className="text-theme-3 hover:underline"> regular
                flushing</Link> to remove sediment buildup, tankless units require different maintenance procedures.
