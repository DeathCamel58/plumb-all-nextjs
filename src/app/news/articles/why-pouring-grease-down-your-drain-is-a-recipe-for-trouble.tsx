      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> According to plumbing industry statistics, FOGs (Fats, Oils, and Grease) are responsible for approximately 47% of all sewer overflows in the United States annually. These blockages cost municipalities and homeowners millions of dollars in repairs and can lead to environmental contamination when sewage backs up into homes or overflows into waterways.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Your kitchen sink is the unsung hero of your culinary adventures, handling everything from washing produce to cleaning dishes after a hearty meal.
        With a garbage disposal installed, it&#39;s tempting to think your sink can handle almost anything. However, there&#39;s one category of kitchen waste that should
        <strong> never</strong> go down your drain: FOGs—Fats, Oils, and Grease. This seemingly innocent trio can transform from helpful cooking ingredients
        to plumbing nightmares in a matter of minutes. Let&#39;s explore why these substances pose such a significant threat to your home&#39;s plumbing system.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Science Behind FOG Clogs</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Understanding why FOGs are so problematic requires a quick lesson in basic chemistry. When hot, these substances exist in liquid form,
        flowing easily down drains. However, the transformation that occurs as they cool is what creates plumbing disasters:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How FOGs Create Clogs</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Phase change:</strong> Grease transitions from liquid to solid as it cools</li>
          <li><strong>Adhesion:</strong> Solidified fats stick to pipe walls, creating a sticky surface</li>
          <li><strong>Accumulation:</strong> The sticky surface captures food particles and other debris</li>
          <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Over time, the pipe&#39;s diameter narrows, reducing water flow</li>
          <li><strong>Blockage:</strong> Eventually, the pipe becomes completely obstructed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Cities and municipalities across the country have strict regulations against disposing of FOGs in drains. The reason is clear:
        when hot grease cools inside your pipes, it solidifies and adheres to pipe walls. This process occurs gradually and out of sight,
        making it particularly dangerous. While you might think running hot water simultaneously would prevent solidification,
        the grease eventually cools further down in your plumbing system, where it can combine with other debris to form stubborn blockages.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Beyond your home&#39;s plumbing, FOGs contribute to massive problems in municipal sewer systems. These substances can form what utility
        workers call &#34;fatbergs&#34;—enormous masses of congealed fat, sometimes weighing several tons, that block sewer lines and require
        expensive, labor-intensive removal procedures.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never pour cooking oils, bacon grease, or other fatty substances down your drain,
          even if you run hot water afterward. The solidification happens further down in your pipes where you can&#39;t see it.
          A single pan of bacon grease can contaminate up to 6,000 gallons of water!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Warning Signs of a FOG Clog</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Recognizing the early signs of a grease clog can help you address the issue before it becomes a major problem:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Slow-draining sink, especially in the kitchen</li>
        <li>Gurgling sounds when water goes down the drain</li>
        <li>Unpleasant odors coming from the drain</li>
        <li>Water backing up into other drains when using the sink</li>
        <li>Multiple drains clogging simultaneously (indicating a main line issue)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">DIY Solutions for FOG-Related Clogs</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you suspect a grease clog is forming in your pipes, try these home remedies before calling a professional:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Step-by-Step Clog Removal</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Pour ½ cup of baking soda directly into the drain</li>
          <li>Follow with 1 cup of white vinegar</li>
          <li>Cover the drain immediately to contain the reaction</li>
          <li>Wait 30 minutes for the mixture to work</li>
          <li>Flush with very hot (not boiling) water for 1-2 minutes</li>
          <li>Repeat if necessary for stubborn clogs</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The baking soda and vinegar combination creates a natural chemical reaction that helps break down fatty acids in grease,
        converting them into soap-like substances that wash away more easily. For particularly stubborn clogs, you may need to repeat
        this process several times or ultimately seek professional assistance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If DIY methods fail to resolve the issue, it&#39;s time to call a professional plumber. Attempting to use chemical drain cleaners
        on grease clogs can sometimes worsen the problem or damage your pipes, especially if you have older plumbing systems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Preventing Future FOG Clogs</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The best approach to FOG clogs is prevention. Establishing good kitchen habits can save you from expensive plumbing repairs
        and the inconvenience of dealing with backed-up drains. Here&#39;s how to properly dispose of cooking fats, oils, and grease:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Safe Disposal Methods for FOGs</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Cool and trash:</strong> Pour cooled grease into a disposable container and throw it in the trash</li>
          <li><strong>Wipe before washing:</strong> Use paper towels to wipe pans before washing to remove excess grease</li>
          <li><strong>Use a collector:</strong> Install a grease trap or collector for your sink if you cook with oils frequently</li>
          <li><strong>Recycle:</strong> For large amounts of cooking oil, check if your community has a recycling program</li>
          <li><strong>Compost (certain oils):</strong> Small amounts of vegetable oils can sometimes be composted with plenty of dry material</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        By adopting these simple practices, you&#39;ll not only protect your home&#39;s plumbing system but also contribute to maintaining
        the health of your community&#39;s sewer infrastructure. Remember that preventing a clog is always easier and less expensive
        than fixing one after it occurs.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When to Call a Professional</h2>
