      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Top Factors Influencing Water Quality</h2>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">1: Water Source</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          The origin of your water plays a pivotal role in determining its quality. Whether it comes
          from surface water sources such as rivers, lakes, or reservoirs, or from groundwater sources
          like wells, the mineral content, pollutants, and contaminants can vary. Understanding the
          source of your water is the first step in assessing potential water quality issues.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2: Treatment Procedures</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Municipal water treatment facilities employ a range of processes to purify water before it
          reaches your home. These processes typically involve filtration, chlorination, and disinfection.
          Adequate treatment is crucial to eliminate harmful pathogens and impurities that could impact
          water quality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">3: Pipe Material and Age</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          The pipes responsible for conveying water to your residence can significantly influence its quality.
          Older pipes constructed from materials such as lead, galvanized steel, or copper may leach
          contaminants into the water. In contrast, modern pipes made from materials like PVC or PEX are
          less likely to affect water quality. Regular inspections and maintenance are key to identifying
          potential issues.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">4: Corrosion and Scaling</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Corrosion and scaling within the plumbing system can alter the taste, odor, and appearance of the water.
          Corroded pipes may release heavy metals like lead or copper, jeopardizing water safety. Proper water
          treatment and addressing corrosion issues within the plumbing system are essential for maintaining
          water quality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">5: Chlorine and Disinfection Byproducts</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Chlorine is commonly utilized to disinfect water and eliminate harmful microorganisms. However,
          the reaction of chlorine with organic matter can result in the formation of disinfection byproducts
          (DBPs), which may have potential health implications. Regular water testing can identify the
          presence of DBPs.

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates over 90 contaminants
          in public drinking water systems. Regular testing is the only way to ensure your water meets these
          safety standards, especially if you rely on a private well.

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">6: Nitrates and Contaminants</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Nitrates, often originating from agricultural runoff, and contaminants like pesticides and industrial
          chemicals can infiltrate water sources. These substances can pose health risks, particularly for
          infants and pregnant women. Regular testing and proper treatment are essential to address these concerns.
        </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">7: Hardness and Minerals</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Water hardness, caused by minerals such as calcium and magnesium, can affect water quality and lead
          to issues like scale buildup in appliances and pipes. While not a health concern, addressing water
          hardness can enhance the efficiency of your plumbing system and appliances.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">8: pH Levels</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">
          The pH level of water indicates its acidity or alkalinity. Water with extreme pH levels can impact
          taste, corrosion potential, and the effectiveness of treatment processes. Maintaining proper pH
          levels ensures optimal water quality and system performance.

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The ideal pH range for drinking water is between 6.5 and 8.5. Water
          outside this range can cause metallic tastes, staining, and may even damage your plumbing system
          over time. Simple home test kits can help you monitor your water&#39;s pH level.

        <p className="mb-0">
          Sediment, particles, and debris in water can affect its clarity and quality. Proper filtration
          systems can eliminate these impurities and improve the overall appearance and taste of your water.

        <p className="mb-0">
          Cross-connections, where non-potable water sources come into contact with the potable water supply,
          can introduce contaminants. The installation and maintenance of backflow prevention devices can
          safeguard against potential contamination.
