      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          Did you know? A single slab leak can waste up to 10,000 gallons of water per month, potentially causing thousands of dollars in damage to your home&#39;s foundation, walls, and flooring.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        That damp spot on your floor or the unexplained increase in your water bill might be more than just a minor inconvenience—it could be a warning sign of a slab leak. These hidden plumbing issues can quickly escalate from subtle symptoms to major structural damage if left unaddressed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Slab Leaks</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Slab leaks occur when water pipes beneath your home&#39;s concrete foundation develop leaks. These can stem from various factors, including:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>External forces like significant ground shifts due to rainfall or drought</li>
        <li>Corrosion of copper pipes due to soil chemistry or water quality</li>
        <li>Abrasion from pipes rubbing against concrete or rebar</li>
        <li>Poor installation or low-quality materials</li>
        <li>High water pressure consistently straining your plumbing system</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        During rainy periods, the ground beneath your home may expand and contract, causing breaks and cracks in the non-breathable concrete foundation. Internally, factors like bathrooms, clothes dryers, and cooking can contribute to humidity levels that accelerate pipe deterioration.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Warning Signs You Shouldn&#39;t Ignore</h2>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Unexplained Increase in Water Bills</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">A sudden spike in your water bill without a change in usage patterns is often the first indicator of a hidden leak.</p>
          <p><strong>Severity Level:</strong> Moderate - Indicates a problem that needs attention soon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Warm Spots on Your Floor</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">If you notice areas of your floor that are unexpectedly warm, especially with slab heating systems, it could indicate a hot water line leak beneath.</p>
          <p><strong>Severity Level:</strong> High - Hot water leaks can cause rapid damage and waste energy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Sound of Running Water</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Hearing water flowing when no fixtures are in use is a clear warning sign of a leak somewhere in your system.</p>
          <p><strong>Severity Level:</strong> High - Indicates an active leak that requires immediate attention.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Cracks in Walls or Flooring</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Foundation shifts due to water erosion can cause visible cracks in your home&#39;s structure.</p>
          <p><strong>Severity Level:</strong> Very High - Suggests structural damage may already be occurring.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Mold or Excessive Moisture</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Unexplained mold growth, musty odors, or damp carpeting can indicate water seeping up through the foundation.</p>
          <p><strong>Severity Level:</strong> High - Poses both structural and health risks.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Addressing Them Matters</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Unchecked slab leaks can start with minor inconveniences and escalate rapidly. If neglected, you face significant financial losses and potential risks to you and your family:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Substantial increases in monthly water bills, sometimes hundreds of dollars</li>
        <li>Higher utility costs as heightened humidity forces your HVAC unit to work harder</li>
        <li>Mold and mildew growth leading to health concerns and unpleasant odors</li>
        <li>Foundation damage that can cost tens of thousands to repair</li>
        <li>Decreased property value due to structural issues</li>
        <li>Potential insurance complications if the leak is deemed a long-term maintenance issue</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">When to Call a Professional</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>As soon as you suspect a slab leak—early detection is crucial</li>
          <li>If your water meter runs when all fixtures are turned off</li>
          <li>When you notice any of the warning signs mentioned above</li>
          <li>Before attempting any DIY fixes that could worsen the situation</li>
          <li>If your home is more than 20 years old with original plumbing</li>
