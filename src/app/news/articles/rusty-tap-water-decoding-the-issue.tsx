        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          Did you know? According to the EPA, rusty water is typically not a health hazard, but it can indicate plumbing issues that need attention. Discolored water can contain iron, manganese, or sediment that, while generally safe, may stain fixtures and affect taste. Identifying the source is crucial for effective resolution.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Discovering brown, rusty water flowing from your faucet can be alarming, but there&#39;s no need to panic.
        This common plumbing issue has several potential causes, and with proper diagnosis, most can be resolved
        quickly. Understanding the pattern of discoloration is your first step toward an effective solution.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Diagnosing the Source of Rusty Water</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The key to resolving rusty water issues lies in proper diagnosis. By observing which faucets are affected
        and whether the discoloration appears in hot water, cold water, or both, you can narrow down the potential causes:

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Quick Diagnostic Checklist</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Check if discoloration affects both hot and cold water</li>
          <li>Note whether all faucets or only certain ones show rusty water</li>
          <li>Observe if the water clears after running for a few minutes</li>
          <li>Check with neighbors to see if they&#39;re experiencing similar issues</li>
          <li>Contact your local water authority about any recent maintenance</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When Both Hot and Cold Tap Water Are Discolored</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If both hot and cold water appear rusty, the issue likely originates outside your home&#39;s plumbing system.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Common External Causes:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Water main breaks or repairs in your neighborhood</li>
        <li>Hydrant flushing by local fire departments</li>
        <li>Municipal water system maintenance</li>
        <li>Sediment disturbance in main water lines</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Should you notice brown sediment or residue in both hot and cold water, check for community &#34;boil water warnings&#34;
        to determine if this is a widespread issue. If not, promptly contact your local water authority to inquire
        about any recent maintenance on water mains. This can help identify the cause and estimate the time until
        your water supply returns to normal.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Does it Mean When Only Hot Water Appears Discolored?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        When rusty water is isolated to hot water faucets while cold water remains clear, your{" "}
        <Link href="/news/article/warning-signs-that-your-water-heater-requires-attention" className="text-theme-1 hover:text-theme-2 transition">hot water heater</Link>{" "}
        is the most likely culprit.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Water Heater Warning Signs:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Brown or reddish hot water</li>
        <li>Metallic taste or smell in hot water</li>
        <li>Sediment or particles visible in hot water</li>
        <li>Reduced hot water pressure</li>
        <li>Unusual noises from your water heater</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Sediment accumulation in the water heater can lead to rusty brown water and accelerate tank corrosion.
        Address this issue promptly to prevent potential damage to your water heater. Sediment buildup
        increases the risk of leaks, cracks, and even complete tank failure.
      </p>

          <Link href="/news/article/flushing-your-water-heater" className="text-theme-1 hover:text-theme-2 transition">flushing your water heater</Link>{" "}
          tank to eliminate sediment buildup. This simple maintenance task can extend your water heater&#39;s lifespan and improve water quality. If signs of corrosion are already present, seek guidance from a professional plumber.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Does it Mean When Rusty Tap Water Is Limited to Certain Faucets?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        When rusty water appears only from specific faucets, the issue is likely isolated to the pipes serving those fixtures.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Localized Causes and Solutions:</strong></p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Corroded galvanized pipes in older sections of plumbing</li>
        <li>Rust buildup in rarely used fixtures</li>
        <li>Recent plumbing work that disturbed sediment</li>
        <li>Deteriorating faucet components</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Older plumbing systems often use galvanized pipes that naturally corrode over time. Running the water
        for approximately 20 minutes may sometimes clear out small amounts of rust. However, if the issue persists,
        replacing the affected pipe sections may be necessary for a permanent solution.
