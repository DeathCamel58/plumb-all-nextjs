        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> The average household requires water pressure between 40-60 psi (pounds per square inch) for optimal performance. Pressure below 30 psi can cause significant issues with everyday tasks, while pressure above 80 psi can damage your plumbing system over time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Have you ever turned on your shower, expecting a refreshing blast of water, only to be met with a disappointing trickle? Or perhaps you&#39;ve noticed your washing machine taking forever to fill? Low water pressure can transform simple daily tasks into frustrating ordeals.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Beyond the inconvenience, inadequate water pressure often signals underlying issues within your home&#39;s plumbing system that deserve attention before they develop into costly problems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Water Pressure: The Basics</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Water pressure is the force that pushes water through your pipes and out of your fixtures. It&#39;s typically measured in pounds per square inch (psi) at the point where water enters your home from the municipal supply or private well.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What Affects Your Home&#39;s Water Pressure?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Homes at higher elevations typically experience lower water pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Distance from water source:</strong> The further you are from the main water supply, the lower your pressure may be</li>
          <li><strong>Peak usage times:</strong> Pressure can drop during high-demand periods in your neighborhood</li>
          <li><strong>Pipe diameter:</strong> Smaller pipes restrict water flow and reduce pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Pipe condition:</strong> Corroded or clogged pipes significantly impact water pressure</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Adequate water pressure ensures you can run multiple fixtures simultaneously without issues. Imagine being able to take a shower while someone else runs the dishwasherâ€”proper water pressure makes this everyday scenario possible without either fixture suffering from reduced flow.

      <p className="mb-6">
        While low water pressure is frustrating, excessive pressure brings its own set of problems. High pressure (above 80 psi) can:

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Low Water Pressure Issues and Solutions</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Low water pressure can affect your entire home or just specific fixtures. Let&#39;s explore the most common issues and how to address them:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Insufficient Water Pressure in the Shower</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        There&#39;s nothing worse than a weak shower when you&#39;re trying to rinse shampoo from your hair. If your shower pressure is disappointing, the culprit is often:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Mineral deposits clogging the showerhead (especially in hard water areas)</li>
        <li>A flow restrictor that&#39;s limiting water output</li>
        <li>Partially closed water valves</li>
        <li>Shared water usage with other fixtures or appliances</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-gray-300">
        <p className="italic text-gray-700">
          <strong>Quick Fix:</strong> Remove your showerhead and soak it overnight in white vinegar to dissolve mineral buildup. For persistent issues, check that the shower valve is fully open or consider replacing an older showerhead with a high-pressure model.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Sudden Drops in Water Pressure</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you experience an abrupt drop in water pressure after initially turning on the tap, this could signal:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>A clogged pipe restricting water flow</li>
        <li>Corroded galvanized pipes narrowing the water pathway</li>
        <li>A partially closed main water valve</li>
        <li>Municipal water supply issues affecting your neighborhood</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Water supply lines accumulate minerals, rust, and sediment over time, creating blockages that restrict flow. These clogs typically require professional attention, as they may be located deep within your plumbing system.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Reduced Hot Water Pressure Only</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        When only your hot water pressure is low, the issue likely involves your water heater:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Sediment buildup in the water heater tank</li>
        <li>Partially closed water heater valve</li>
        <li>Corroded or clogged hot water pipes</li>
        <li>Failing water heater pressure regulator</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Important:</strong> If you notice reduced hot water pressure, check your water heater&#39;s temperature and pressure relief valve. A malfunctioning valve can be dangerous and should be addressed immediately by a professional plumber.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Low Water Pressure from Leaky Plumbing</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Hidden leaks are silent thieves of water pressure. When water escapes through leaks before reaching your fixtures, pressure drops significantly. Watch for these warning signs:
      </p>
