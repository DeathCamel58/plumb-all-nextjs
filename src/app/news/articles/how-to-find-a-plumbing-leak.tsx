      <p className="mb-6">
        Finding plumbing leaks in your home can be challenging, primarily because they&#39;re often hidden
        from plain sight. Many homeowners only discover these leaks after noticing a significant increase
        in their water bills or, worse, when expensive appliances or walls suffer damage.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        To prevent such costly issues, it&#39;s important to identify and address leaks early.
        This guide will walk you through several effective methods to detect plumbing leaks in your home.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> According to the EPA, household leaks can waste nearly 10,000 gallons
          of water each year. That&#39;s enough water to wash 300 loads of laundry! Detecting and fixing leaks
          promptly not only saves money but also conserves this valuable resource.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Monitor Your Water Bill</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        One of the simplest ways to detect a plumbing leak is by monitoring your water bill.
        Check your bills for the past few months to see if there&#39;s been a consistent rise or
        if they&#39;re higher than usual without an obvious explanation.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If your water usage (measured in gallons per month) is higher than normal and you can&#39;t
        identify a reason for the increase, you might be dealing with a plumbing leak.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Many water utility companies provide online access to your water
          usage history. Some even offer tools that can alert you to unusual spikes in consumption,
          helping you catch leaks early.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Once you&#39;ve confirmed a potential leak through your water bill, it&#39;s advisable to contact
        a professional plumber, especially if your pipes are underground or in a concrete slab.
        Professional plumbers have specialized equipment to locate these hidden leaks without
        causing unnecessary damage to your property.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Check Your Water Meter</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Your water meter can be an excellent tool for identifying leaks. To use this method,
        first ensure that all water-using appliances and fixtures in your home are turned off.
        This includes washing machines, dishwashers, ice makers, and any automatic irrigation systems.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How to Check Your Water Meter for Leaks</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Turn off all water</strong> in your home, including appliances that use water automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Locate your water meter</strong>, typically found near the street or sidewalk in a concrete box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the meter reading</strong> and note the position of the leak indicator (usually a small triangle or dial).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait 2 hours</strong> without using any water in your home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the meter again</strong>. If the reading has changed or the leak indicator is moving, you likely have a leak.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you observe the water meter changing despite having turned off all water sources,
        it&#39;s a clear indication of a plumbing leak in your home. Fast-moving leaks will cause
        the meter to count up continuously, while slower leaks might require a longer observation
        period to notice any change.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Use Food Coloring to Check Toilet Leaks</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Toilets account for approximately 30% of your home&#39;s total water consumption, making them
        a common source of leaks. Fortunately, there&#39;s a simple method to check if your toilet is leaking.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">The Food Coloring Test</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Remove the toilet tank lid</strong> and set it aside safely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add several drops of food coloring</strong> to the water in the tank.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait 15-30 minutes</strong> without flushing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the toilet bowl</strong>. If you see colored water in the bowl, your toilet has a leak.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This leak occurs when water drains from the tank into the bowl without the toilet being flushed,
        typically due to a worn flapper valve that&#39;s not creating a proper seal. Replacing the flapper
        is usually a simple and inexpensive fix that can save significant amounts of water.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Pay Attention to Water Pressure</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Changes in water pressure can sometimes indicate plumbing leaks. If you notice a drop in
        water pressure, try turning off all fixtures and then take a shower or fill the bathtub.
        If there&#39;s a leak, you might experience higher water pressure because the leaking fixture
        is no longer diverting water.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Important:</strong> A drop in water pressure doesn&#39;t always indicate a leak.
          It could also be caused by clogged fixtures, municipal water supply issues, or problems
          with your pressure regulator. If you&#39;re unsure, it&#39;s best to consult with a professional plumber.
