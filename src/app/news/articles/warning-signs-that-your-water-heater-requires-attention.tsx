      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-theme-3">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Did you know?</strong> The average water heater lasts between 8-12 years, but proper maintenance can extend its lifespan by up to 50%. Recognizing early warning signs can help you avoid costly emergency replacements and ensure consistent hot water supply for your home.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Your water heater works tirelessly behind the scenes, providing hot water for everything from morning showers to evening dishwashing.
        When this essential appliance begins to fail, it can disrupt your daily routine and potentially lead to water damage in your home.
        Maintaining optimal functionality of your water heater is crucial throughout the year, especially during colder months when demand increases.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Many homeowners overlook warning indicators until the situation becomes critical—often resulting in cold showers and emergency repair costs.
        Understanding key signals can empower you to address water heater issues proactively. Let&#39;s explore the significant signs that indicate
        your water heater needs professional attention from Plumb-All in Jonesboro, GA.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Significant Fluctuations in Water Temperature</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        One of the most noticeable signs of water heater trouble is inconsistent water temperature. If your shower suddenly alternates
        between scalding hot and ice cold, your water heater is likely struggling to maintain proper temperature regulation.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Temperature Fluctuation Warning Signs</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Inconsistent heating:</strong> Water that never reaches the set temperature</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature swings:</strong> Sudden changes from hot to cold during use</li>
          <li><strong>Delayed heating:</strong> Increasingly longer wait times for hot water</li>
          <li><strong>Cold water only:</strong> Complete failure to heat water (most severe stage)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        These temperature issues often indicate problems with the heating elements, thermostat, or sediment buildup inside the tank.
        Rapid changes in temperature warrant immediate attention from a professional technician at Plumb-All. Timely intervention
        is crucial to identify and rectify the root cause before complete system failure occurs.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Unusual Noises Coming From Your Water Heater</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A properly functioning water heater operates quietly. If you begin hearing unusual sounds coming from your water heater,
        it&#39;s time to pay attention. These noises are often caused by sediment buildup at the bottom of the tank.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Popping or rumbling:</strong> Sediment has formed a crust that traps water underneath, creating bubbling sounds when heated</li>
        <li><strong>Cracking or ticking:</strong> Mineral scale buildup on heating elements</li>
        <li><strong>Banging or hammering:</strong> Water hammer effect from pressure changes in pipes</li>
        <li><strong>High-pitched whining:</strong> Possible valve or pressure issues</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Regular maintenance, including annual flushing of your water heater tank, can prevent sediment buildup
          and extend the life of your unit. This simple procedure removes minerals and debris that accumulate over time, improving efficiency
          and reducing strange noises.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Hot Water Leakage</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Water leaking from your water heater is never normal and always requires immediate attention. Even small leaks can indicate
        serious problems and may quickly escalate into major issues if left unaddressed.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Common Causes of Water Heater Leaks</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Loose connections:</strong> Pipe fittings or valve connections may need tightening</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure relief valve issues:</strong> The valve may be faulty or responding to excessive pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Internal tank corrosion:</strong> The most serious cause, often requiring replacement</li>
          <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Not actually a leak, but can be confused with one (less concerning)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Initially, leakage might be minimal, catching your attention only when it escalates into a more significant problem.
        Recognizing any hot water leakage serves as a crucial signal that demands immediate repair. Addressing this issue promptly
        is a proactive measure that can save you both time and money in the long term.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Rusty or Discolored Water</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If your hot water appears rusty, cloudy, or has an unusual odor, your water heater may be corroding internally.
        This is particularly common in older units and those in areas with hard water.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Rusty water specifically from hot water taps (but not cold) typically indicates that the anode rod in your water heater
        has deteriorated and the tank itself may be corroding. This sacrificial rod is designed to attract corrosive elements
        and protect the tank, but it needs replacement every few years.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-gray-200">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Simple Test for Water Heater Corrosion</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Fill three clear glasses with hot water from a tap close to your water heater</li>
          <li>Fill three more glasses with cold water from the same tap</li>
          <li>If only the hot water samples are discolored, your water heater is likely the source</li>
          <li>If all samples are discolored, the issue may be in your main water supply</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Reduced Hot Water Supply</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you notice that your hot water doesn&#39;t last as long as it used to, your water heater may be struggling due to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Sediment buildup reducing tank capacity</li>
        <li>Heating element failure</li>
        <li>Thermostat issues</li>
        <li>Increased household demand exceeding capacity</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A professional can diagnose whether your system needs repair, maintenance, or if it&#39;s time to consider
        upgrading to a larger capacity or more efficient model. If you&#39;re experiencing frequent issues with your
        traditional water heater, it might be worth exploring
