          Did you know? According to the National Association of Realtors, bathroom remodels can recover up to 102% of their cost at resale, while kitchen updates typically return 80-85% of investment. Strategic plumbing improvements offer some of the highest returns on investment when selling your home.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5 High-Value Plumbing Upgrades for Home Sellers</h2>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-6">
        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Install a Whole-House Water Filtration System</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Today&#39;s health-conscious buyers increasingly prioritize water quality, making filtration systems a compelling selling point.</p>
          <p><strong>Benefits for Buyers:</strong></p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Eliminates the ongoing expense of bottled water</li>
            <li>Provides cleaner, better-tasting water from every tap</li>

            <li>Offers peace of mind regarding water contaminants</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Investment Tip:</strong> Choose a system that addresses your local water quality issues specifically. In areas with hard water, consider a combination filtration/softening system for maximum appeal.</p>
        </li>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Revamp Your Bathroom with Strategic Updates</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Bathrooms significantly influence buying decisions, but complete remodels aren&#39;t always necessary to make a positive impression.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Impact, Low-Cost Updates:</strong></p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2 space-y-1">

        </li>

        <li>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Address All Existing Plumbing Issues</h3>
